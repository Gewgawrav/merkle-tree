# merkle-tree

This library implements a merkle-tree data structure, for representing a list of
hashed data as a binary tree of pairs of hashes converging to a single hash, the
`merkle root`. SHA3_256 is used as the hashing algorithm.

# TODO
- Explain merkle tree construction
- Explain merkle proofs and what they are used for
- Give example of usage
